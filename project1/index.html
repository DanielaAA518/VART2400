                    There’s a village sixty miles outside London. It’s no different from many other villages in England: one pub, one church, red-brick cottages, council cottages and a few bigger houses dotted about. Voices rise up, as they might do anywhere, speaking of loving and needing and working and dying and walking the dogs.</p></div>
                    <br>

            <div class="blurb2">
                    <p>This village belongs to the people who live in it and to the people who lived in it hundreds of years ago. It belongs to England’s mysterious past and its confounding present. But it also belongs to Dead Papa Toothwort, a figure schoolchildren used to draw green and leafy, choked by tendrils growing out of his mouth.</p>

            <div class="blurb3">
                    <p>Dead Papa Toothwort is awake. He is listening to this twenty-first-century village, to his English symphony. He is listening, intently, for a mischievous, enchanting boy whose parents have recently made the village their home. Lanny.

                <p>“Responsive to the light, I would call it. The type of person who is that little bit more akin to the weather than most people, more obviously made of the same atoms as the earth than most people these days seem to be. Which explains Lanny.”<br>

                <br>

                “Ah, Lanny, my friend, look at these blank pages. <br>
                Don't you feel like God at the start of the ages?<br>
                You could do anything,”<br>

                <br>

                "Rain finds away around me, runs off me"<br>

                <br>

                “But darling we’ve talked about this so often, you cannot fix the way the world is broken all on your own.”
