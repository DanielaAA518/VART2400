        <h1>what is a website?</h1>

        <br>

        <p>i like the idea of a website as something temporal. it’s as affected by time as we are, but even as it grows with us, its immortality means it’s impossible to leave a website in the past. when we create websites, we create little stamps of time that, unlike books, don’t end when we read to the bottom of the page or click to a new one. we’re always able to come back to who we were at the time of creation, so in a sense, the handmade web is a little pocket of time, immortal and temporary and timeless.</p>

        <br>

        <p>being that website are most perfectly temporal when made by hand, when we can appreciate the active, physical process of building them, the web needs to belong first and foremost to the individual. websites are nodes on an interconnected network, each node connecting to different places and different people and different times. the beauty of their interaction can’t be as appreciated when websites belong to companies and their templates alone. the web isn’t a web if all that exists on it are pages dedicated to advertising to masses rather than connecting with individuals. websites should be a reflection not just of temporality but of communication.</p>
            
        <br>
        
        <p>and that’s why it’s important to be sensitive when we describe websites as technology. when we try to track a site’s usefulness or impact by the latest technological advancements, we lose so much authenticity. a bare-bones, handmade website is as much a piece of technology as the latest, AI-generated site built on the backs of other bare-bones, handmade sites. technology is so often the lens through which we look at time and space, and a handmade site exemplifies that more than most ‘technologically advanced’ sites ever could.</p>
