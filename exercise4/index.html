        <h1>The Web's Grain</h1>

        <p>
            i will always appreciate any discussion that views web design as another facet of art, not just technology. the way Frank Chimero sees websites as comparable to more traditional forms of art like photography—the foundations of the graphic with the extended capabilities that technology affords—is exactly how i’d like to start viewing websites myself. it’s similar to the opinion Laurel Schwulst conveys in My Website is a Shifting House—when websites are whittled down to the technology that creates them, that is how templates arise. there isn’t as much soul in them, there isn’t as much passion, just as there is nowhere near as much passion in an AI-generated artwork compared to a handmade one. in fact, there’s no passion at all. just like with AI, websites are a technological tool that can assist in the creation of art—the site itself. they are not technological alone. <br>

            <br>

            that said, it is no less important to recognise the newness, the expanded horizons, that websites, being technology, can afford us. i think Chimero does well to describe these horizons without taking away from the viewpoint of websites and the web as art. his discussion of edgelessness and all its forms, from endless scrollability to the eternal nature of linking from one page to another til the end of time, was particularly eye-opening. just like any medium, websites have specific capabilities that it doesn’t share with other mediums, and that’s no less the truth just because it’s technological. ultimately, Chimero explains just why the intersectionality of art and technology is so important to me; websites are both, and should be regarded as such.
