        <h1>Website Critique - Handshake</h1>

        <br>

        <p>
            Handshake is a job board site that caters its applications to students based on the university they attend. Fordham University students have Handshake-access to specific jobs that other universities may not see on the board, and vice versa. It also connects users to school-specific resources, like career fairs or alumni panels.<br>
        
            <br>

            Handshake’s design system is very seamless. Throughout the site, buttons are either indigo with white text, or white with indigo text and borders. Paler tints of this indigo colour are activated when you hover over certain elements, like items in the nav bar, and if indigo is not used, a light grey colour is used instead, both of which match other elements of the site like its background and text colours. All buttons are rounded, and the most prominent pieces of text like company or job names are underlined when you hover over them. This is consistent throughout the site.
        </p>

            <h2>Homepage</h2>

            <p>The website is very accessible, providing clear navigation from its home page with a nav bar on the left (Jobs, Events, Employers, Inbox, Career center), and an icon for notifications and a user’s profile on the top right. The homepage contains information on upcoming events, employer reviews, and pop-ups from your inbox, but all of it is displayed clearly, and nothing overwhelms. Calls to action such as ‘The best way to get noticed by your employers? Reach out’ are the largest, boldest font on the home page, and subheadings like ‘Attend an event’ or ‘What’s it really like to work there?’ are slightly smaller, but still bold to draw attention. Overall, the Handshake website excels at typographic hierarchy, presenting necessary information in clear, concise ways that draw users’ attention without splitting or overwhelming it.</p>

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/homepage.png">
                </div>

                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/homepage2.png">
                </div>
            </section>
            </p>

            <h2>Jobs</h2>
            <p>The jobs page itself has a scrollable list of jobs taking up toward the left, and the currently selected job and its details taking up the majority of the screen. Once again, typographic hierarchy seamlessly directs the users’ gaze to first the job’s title, the company posting it, and posted date/application deadlines. Newly-added jobs have a Fresh icon in red, and while red isn’t otherwise used much in the site’s colour scheme, I don’t think it detracts from the scheme, and functions cohesively as a call to action. One recommendation I’d have involves the scroll bar toward the top of the page, where you can filther applications by things like location, whether they’re onsite or remote, and whether they’re a full time position or an internship. Upon scrolling, only one more filter appears that you don’t already see from the default position. I feel like it isn’t necessary for a user to scroll to see one more option, so perhaps those buttons should be sized smaller. Otherwise, the jobs page is very usable.

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/jobs.png">
                </div>
            </section>
            </p>

            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>The events page is similarly readable. It is slightly busier. Listed events have colour-coded tags that further describe which kind of event they are (‘career fair’ in light purple, ‘networking’ in coral, ‘hiring’ in light green, ‘employer info’ in light blue). While I don’t think these tags are a bad idea, and the colour coding is helpful, there seems to be a lot of unnecessary overlap. For example, aren’t career fairs networking opportunities? If that’s true, career fair events don’t have the ‘networking’ tag, just the ‘career fair’ tag. One suggestion would be to more narrowly define the tags, so there is no confusion for users.

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/events.png">
                </div>
            </section>
            </p>

            <h2>Employers and Inbox</h2>
            <p>The employers page continues Handshake’s organisational prowess, with separate boxes for filters, a list of overall employers, and a list of employers the user follows. That said, this page has very little colour other than the base colours of white, grey, and black. This may be because a lot of colour finds itself in the logos for each employer company, but that hasn’t limited Handshake from using colour in other pages. This page, on the other hand, is not recognisable as a Handshake page as much as other pages on the site are; it could feasibly belong to any other job board site. I’d suggest bringing in more colours from the design system, like the characteristic indigo accent colour, to better distinguish the employers page as a Handshake page. These same critiques could apply to the inbox page, which, again, is very clearly organised and readable, but has almost no distinguishing colours.

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/employers.png">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/inbox.png">
                </div>
            </section>
            </p>

            <h2>Career center</h2>
            <p>The Career center page is perhaps Handshake’s busiest page, and this is where their organisational skills don’t translate as well as they do with other pages. There are still boxes delineating information, with helpful links in light blue to separate them from other pieces of text, but overall, most text on this page is quite similar in size, and quite small. There aren’t many calls to action, so it is difficult for users to know what kind of resources the career center offers, and where to even find that information. The typographic hierarchy that Handshake has otherwise excelled at, falls flat here. That would be the first fix I would offer, increasing the size of certain pieces of text like headings. I would also suggest that some information on this page be taken out. The amount currently on it borders on overwhelming, which no other page does. Either merge this information into one box that can then link to all the info, or take some of this info out entirely.

            <section class="flex-area">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/careercenter2.png">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="images/careercenter.png">
                </div>
            </section>
            </p>

            <p>Overall, Handshake has very clean, consistent UI design, utilising this to provide a wide variety of information that is nonetheless easily accessible and understood. But for a couple of small usability issues (like busy pages even with well-organised material), Handshake is the sleekest job board site I’ve used thus far, and for all the UI/UX design choices discussed above, it remains the frontrunner of my job search experience.
