        <p>
            Web design was always, first and foremost, an art discipline for me. After taking classes like Visual Thinking and Graphic Design and Digital Tools, after all my immersion in the visual arts, web design was, to me, another art form, another chance to explore visual design. Then, in Fall 2022, I took Internet and Web Programming. I explored web development rather than design. The web suddenly became synonymous with all the other logic-heavy coding classes that have comprised the majority of my major. I immersed myself in understanding of the web as a structure more than just a design. Perhaps a little too much. As words like ‘DOM’ and ‘cookies’ and ‘cache’ started to infiltrate my coursework, I realised that the love I had for web design was cracking little by little. I didn’t want to design just systems, and I didn’t want to design just pages. I want to design both. <br>

            <br>

            This class not only reminded me of the original love I have for web design as an art form, but also taught me that appreciation in so many ways I hadn’t yet found. Armed with the aesthetic appreciation this class has given me, and the logic and structure I leared from my Computer Science classes, I have honed and moulded my love for all things web-related. My college career has almost entirely focused on the intersection between art and technology. This is my passion, this is my expertise. I never want to lean too far into one or the other, I thrive right alone the line between them. This class brought me back to that line after Computer Science began to  pull me too far away from it, and for that I’ll be forever grateful.
